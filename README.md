## Configuring Network Adapters in Windows Server

### Step 1: Access the Network Menu
1. Navigate to the **system tray** at the bottom-right corner of the screen.
2. Locate the **network icon** (it may appear as a globe or Wi-Fi symbol).
3. **Right-click** the network icon to open the menu.

### Step 3: Access Change Adapter Options
1. In the **Network & Internet Settings** window, select **Ethernet** from the left-hand panel.
2. Under **Related settings**, click **Change adapter options**.
3. This opens the **Network Connections** window.

### Step 4: View Available Network Adapters
1. In the **Network Connections** window, youâ€™ll see a list of all available adapters.
   - Each adapter shows its name and current status (e.g., `Network` or `Unidentified network`).

### Step 5: Identify the Internet-Connected Adapter
1. Right-click on each adapter and select **Status** to view its connection details.
2. In the **Ethernet Status** window, click **Details...** to see network properties.

### Step 6: Verify the Internet-Connected Adapter
- Look for the following details in the **Network Connection Details** window:
  1. **IPv4 Address**: `10.0.2.15` (indicates this adapter is active on the network).
  2. **Default Gateway**: `10.0.2.2` (confirms this adapter is used to route traffic to the internet).
  3. **DHCP Enabled**: `Yes` (shows the adapter is receiving its IP address dynamically).

**Explanation:**
- The adapter with a valid **IPv4 Address** and a configured **Default Gateway** is connected to the internet.
- In this case, the adapter with IP `10.0.2.15` is the internet-connected adapter.

### Step 7: Rename the Adapters for Easy Identification
1. In the **Network Connections** window, right-click each adapter and select **Rename**.
2. Rename the adapters as follows:
   - **Adapter connected to the internet:** `_INTERNET_`.
   - **Adapter for internal communication:** `X_internal_X`.

### Benefits of Renaming Adapters
1. **Improved Clarity**:
   - Clearly distinguishes between the external (internet-facing) and internal adapters.
2. **Prevents Configuration Errors**:
   - Makes it easier to assign services like DHCP, DNS, or Active Directory roles.
