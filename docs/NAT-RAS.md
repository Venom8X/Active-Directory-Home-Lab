## Final Notes
- Ensure that the **Windows Firewall** is configured to allow ports required for Routing and Remote Access.
- NAT relies on external DNS and DHCP servers. Verify that these services are running and configured properly.

This configuration enables NAT and routing for internal clients to access the Internet via the public interface on your Windows Server.
