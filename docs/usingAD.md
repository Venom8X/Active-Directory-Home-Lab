## **Explanation**
- **Add a New Forest**:
  - A forest is the highest level of the Active Directory hierarchy. Creating a new forest establishes a new domain.
- **Functional Levels**:
  - Define the features available for the domain and forest.
- **DNS Server**:
  - Enables the server to resolve domain names within the network.
- **Global Catalog (GC)**:
  - Facilitates searching for objects in the directory and speeding up authentication.

Once the server has been promoted to a domain controller, the system will reboot automatically.

### Best Practices for OUs and User Accounts
1. **Organizational Units (OUs)**:
   - Group similar objects (e.g., users, computers) for easier management.
   - Use meaningful names that reflect their purpose (e.g., `_ADMINS`, `HR_Employees`).

2. **User Accounts**:
   - Use consistent naming conventions for usernames.
   - Ensure secure password policies are in place.

These steps ensure efficient management and organization of resources in your Active Directory environment.
